Addendum: How to easily fix a potential exception when rendering a Twig template
A recent update to the Twig template library might cause an error when rendering a template.

You might see an error like this:

Fatal error
Uncaught exception: 'ErrorException'
Message: 'file_get_contents(App/Views/Home/index.html): failed to open stream: No such file or directory'
The problem occurs when creating the Twig environment and passing in the directory where the Twig templates are located.

To fix it, the Core/View.php file needs to be changed, specifically in the renderTemplate  method.

Instead of this line:

$loader = new \Twig_Loader_Filesystem('../App/Views');

you need to change it to this:

$loader = new \Twig_Loader_Filesystem(dirname(__DIR__) . '/App/Views');

All this does is set the template directory, relative to the Core directory, using a different method: the __DIR__ magic constant returns the directory of the current script (in this case Core), and the dirname function returns the parent directory (in this case, the root of our framework).

Updated code is attached to this lecture.

As always, if you have any problems, please let me know!
